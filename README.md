**icarus** (**I**ndirect **C**allsite **A**nalysis and **R**esolution **U**tilitie**S**) is a static analysis tool
operating on top of the [LLVM IR](https://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html) of a program. Originally designed to perform
different types of function pointer analyses, it has been redesigned into a general purpose analysis tool that is
easy to extend for future research projects and experiments to learn more about static analysis in general.

**icarus** is similar to LLVM's in-house [opt](https://llvm.org/docs/CommandGuide/opt.html) tool, except that `opt`
applies code optimization and transformation passes on a per-module basis. This makes it unsuitable to perform
different types of analyses where multiple LLVM IR files need to be analyzed in one single pass. This especially
includes the analysis of the Linux kernel and its modules that were the original target of the **icarus** tool.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

**icarus** was developed on Debian GNU/Linux and requires a small set of freely available binaries for the build to
successfully work. The names of the packages may differ on other distributions.

- `clang-*` and `llvm-*-dev` (`*` >= 4): The static analysis tool operates on the LLVM IR that is generated by the Clang
  compiler. The LLVM libraries contains all the necessary headers and classes needed to build **icarus** and its passes.
- `cmake` (>= 3.9.6): The minimum version of `cmake` was determined using the
  [cmake_min_version](https://github.com/nlohmann/cmake_min_version) tool. Depending on the progress and the complexity
  of the project, the minimum version may change at some point in the future.
- A generator, such as Ninja (`ninja-build`) or Makefile (`make`) to build the **icarus** executable.

### Building

**icarus** is easily built using `cmake` and a suitable generator:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/croemheld/icarus.git
cd icarus
mkdir build && cd build
cmake -G "Ninja" ..
ninja icarus
```
